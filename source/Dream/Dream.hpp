    @section intro Introduction
    The Dream framework is a work that began as early as 2005. It was designed to be a framework that would assist with the development of interactive C++
    applications which could be easily ported across different platforms. It was designed to simplify the way things were programmed in C++, and to reduce
    verbosity of code where it was not needed.

    The framework has relied heavily from external libraries, such as libpng, libjpeg, libfreetype, and others. The idea behind this is not to reinvent the
    wheel, but to provide a set of reliable functionality which is easy to use, well documented, and easy to adapt and extend.

    In many cases, new algorithms and structures have been designed to solve problems, because this is what I enjoy the most.
